# Agricultural Recommendation System based on Deep Learning: A Multivariate Weather Forecasting Approach

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the Agricultural Recommendation System described in the paper titled "Agricultural Recommendation System based on Deep Learning: A Multivariate Weather Forecasting Approach" by Zubair et al. (2024). The system integrates a multivariate weather forecasting model based on deep learning techniques to provide precise agricultural recommendations tailored to specific environmental conditions. By utilizing weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation, the system forecasts future weather patterns and advises farmers on optimal crop types, planting schedules, and irrigation needs.
